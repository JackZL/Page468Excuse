# SourceTest
This is my first program after basic C# learning. I'm trying to make a small program for one of our testing process. it's becasue current was written by visual basic. it's a very old program.

after trial, I found that there are major problem:

1. I don't know how to connect my program with DB.
2. there are some unknown issues which made me can't read the the testing data from instrument.

I'm working on this program until I finish it.
